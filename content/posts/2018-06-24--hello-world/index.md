My name is Septanto. I come from Indonesia.

Currently I am working as a software engineer in one of the leading payment gateway company in Indonesia.

I just began my journey in software engineering earlier this year. My study background is not computer science nor any engineering major. I hold a bachelor degree in literature. So how come I become a software engineer?

Straight after my graduation I took a job in a private bank. But, I didn't find my job fulfilling. So I began to search some new job areas. The software engineering was unthinkable until I saw an ad on instagram about opportunity to learn coding and work as programmer. I was immediately interested.

I used to learn about html and css in the past. So I think that would be suffice fundamental knowledge for programming. I think I would be not so bad at programming.

And I was wrong. Because humbly, I'm quite good at it.

I worked tirelessly to learn various things about programming. I learned JavaScript, PHP, postgreSQL, redis, and now my job require to program web application in a high amount of Java. I try to eat everything.

And I keep asking to myself, what's next? Although, I'm not yet expert in those what I have learned (well, I just learn programming in about 1 year, remember?), but I feel the need to expand beyond building web application.

Now I'm focusing in Natural Language Processing. Why NLP? First, I studied linguistics mainly English linguistics during my university days. So at least I have one fundamental knowledge used in NLP.

So here I am right now. Trying to understand English & Bahasa Indonesia by typing programs in python, after working all day in Java.
